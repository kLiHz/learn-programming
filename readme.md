# Coding Practice

codes inside are several small projects, most of them are imperfect:

## C++:

`proccpp`: Process your C++ source file, i.e. remove all the comments or the definitions. 

`myint`: big int implementation.

`mydate`: A C++ class that can stores and output a date with different styles, with checking and suggesting function.
